                                     for people and families with vulnerabilities across south Sudan
                                      is the way to go. Empowerments of communities lead to greater 
                                      participation and ownership by communities of their own development.
                                       Equipping individuals with information and basic skills to take
                                        responsibility for fixing their homesteads and restoring public
                                         facilities are the most effective ways to impact an entire community.
                                          So when you give to one of our projects, your contribution grows into
                                           more than just a repaired roof or a restored facility. You're helping
                                            rebuild entire communities of south Sudan.
